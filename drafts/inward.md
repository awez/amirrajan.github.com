Sometimes you want to turn inwards, because the world outside feels wrong. You want to have meaningful
conversations with others, but it's socially unacceptable to ask a stranger "What do you want
out of life?". So you stick to "the script":

"Have a good lunch?"

"How was your weekend?"

"How was your holiday break?"

Expecting the same old scripted response.

"It was good."
