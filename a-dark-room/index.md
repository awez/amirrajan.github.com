##A letter to the fans of A Dark Room

I tried to keep this letter spoiler free. If you haven't played the web or mobile version of the game. Please take the time to experience this wonderful journey.

**The History**

A Dark Room for iOS is an official release of the web based version of the game. I worked closely with Michael Townsend to ensure the spirit of the game is captured in a mobile medium. After [quitting my 9-5 job](/meta/2013/07/14/rebooting-life/), this was my first attempt at making something on my own...in delivering software that people enjoy using (as opposed to being just a cog in a corporation).

I came across A Dark Room, June 2013 on Twitter. After playing the game, I knew that this was something important. A work of art. That very same day I contacted Michael Townsend about building a mobile version of this game. Michael, being the awesome dude he is, replied the same day.

>If you want to do a port to iOS, you have my blessings.

A virtual handshake, a snapshot of the source code, 5 months, 70 emails, and 1 video conference later, A Dark Room for iOS shipped.

**The Effort**

A ridiculous amount of work was done to ensure the game's pace transferred well to a mobile device. Literally a 100 hours of hand cramping playthroughs of the game were performed to make sure you would stay engaged. Elements were added to increase the replayability and fun factor. Even a storyline was added to help build a more colorful world in the mind's eye.

I can't reiterate enough how cautious I was in making these changes. It was tough asking friends and family members to play a half baked game. And it was painful to watch every move they made, watch every time they got bored or couldn't figure out what to do. It was especially difficult because each person can only experience the game "for the first time", once. So if there was a miss-step on my part, with regards to the game play or mobile layout, it was a very expensive error.

I was concerned that the changes I made would would ruin the essence of A Dark Room. The absolute last thing I'd ever want is to corrupt the world that the game created. I was very glad that Michael liked the changes and that they were seen as unique experience that complimented the web version.

**The Apology**

I'm glad the game has been well received, for the most part. So far, all the ratings have been 5 stars, except for one. For those that feel the port of the game isn't up to par, I can really only say one thing.

>I'm sorry. From the first day of building the game I wanted to stay true to it. Really. I'm sorry I didn't deliver the experience you were expecting. That wasn't my intention.

If you enjoyed the game. Please, leave us a review in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/a-dark-room/id736683061). 5 stars hopefully.


May the fire burn bright and warm for you. Sincerely,

A Dark Room

**The Rest of the Story**

I want to make sure I an logged of everything that's happend around the growth and popularity of A Dark Room. I hope that indie developers (or those that want to try to "make it" in the App Store) can benefit from these entries. Notable events are listed below along with any pertinent information about how it affected downloads, reviews, and anything else that influnced the success (or failure) of A Dark Room for iOS.

**Jun 29, 2013: Picking the Development Environment**

Starting off I know I didn't want to write this app in Objective C and XCode. I had built a budgeting app using Objective C, Interface Builder and XCode. During my time off, I wanted the experience in building an app using the "recommended" development environment... It was just not fun. I've spent too much time with bloated IDE's and visual designers. I didn't want to experience that again.

My first few lines of A Dark Room code were still in Objective C and XCode. After a day of coding, I got fed up with the environment. I had a copy of RubyMotion sitting on my virtual shelf. I put aside my fears of "using something that isn't supported by Apple", dusted it off, and started building the app in RubyMotion instead.

Coded for 12 hours straight on the game. I haven't had this feeling in a very long time. Losing track of time like that.

**Jul 7, 2013: First Playtest from a Non-Gamer**

I got huts working and had implemented population growth. The game was far from complete. But I took the chance and showed it to a non gamer. The were throughly confused. But slowly got pulled into the game and had built "a tiny village". I consistently heard "it needs pictures, it needs visuals". I actually thought about adding black and white background images to the game that would change as the player progressed. But I wanted to have a complete game before adding my own creativity to it.

**Jul 8, 2013: Realization That I was Growing as a Developer**

Working on the game while at the same time preparing for an Austin .Net user group presantation on using the dynamic capabilities of C#. It's really interesting being proficient in multiple languages now. It's a perspective thats hard to describe. The presentation went well and I was making good progress in flushing out the game.

**Jul 11, 2013: Realization That I Enjoy Helping Others Break Down Barriers**

Did another presentation on ASP.NET MVC web development using the dynamic capabilities of C#. I'd say that this Dallas .Net User Group presentation was the best presentation I've ever done. The turn out was huge (120+ people). I was presenting on ideas I cared about. I was trying to break down barriers for developers, and sharing techniques/workflows to development that just simply aren't practiced on the .Net stack. I hope I showed enough good things about fast feedback loops (out of proc build and deploys, fast test feedback), low friction workflows (command line centric actions)... the Visual Studio IDE and Microsoft created frameworks... just don't seem to value these ideas as much. I see it more now given all the work I've now done using NodeJS, JavaScript, Rails, and Ruby Motion.

**Jul 12, 2013: The First Road Block in Developing A Dark Room**

I hit my first road block. When I reached out to Michael about porting the game to iOS, I actually hadn't finished playing the web version. I never bought the compass to set out on to the Dusty Path. I thought I was making extremely good progress, but then I saw the complexity of the outside world. The economy management was just the tip of the iceberg. The size of the Dusty Path was also a challenge to fit on a tiny screen. It took me 10 days to figure out how to approach the next part of the game. I made tiny sample apps and tried different variations of pinch and zoom techniques, scrolling techniques, "follow the player" techniques, and skeumorphic stuff. Before this day I thought I was so close to finishing the implementation of game....

**Jul 21, 2013: I Want to Stab Cocoa UI In the Face**

I settled on a "follow the player" implemenation where the map would center when the player moved on the map. You could scroll around the map if you needed, but as soon as you moved again, it would refocus to your current location. I had to use two layers of overlapping labels to represent landmarks and terrain (Cocoa UILabels can only have one format). It took 5 days to get the labels lined up and scrolling correctly. Twenty days, just gone on trying to display a map...

**Jul 26, 2013: Making the iOS Version my Own**

At this point I needed to take a break from the Dusty Path and do some polish and play testing. The pacing in the game was an issue. It was too slow to get started. I didn't know if it was because I had played it so many times or if the game was actually just too slow to get going on a mobile medium.

I decided to add Friedrich Nietzsche quotes that would show up randomly when you stoked the fire (to help with the slower points in the game). This didn't make it into the final release, but were in the game for a while. I had accumulated 200 quotes and felt that it was inline with the atmosphere of the game.

**Jul 28, 2013: Creativity is a Drug**

I don't know what it was about these Nietzche quotes. I think it was my first attempt at doing something different and creative... something that set this version apart from the web version. I spent the day incorporating quotes, thinking to myself how awesome it would be and how erie it would make the game. Here are some of them:

>every profound spirit needs a mask: even more, around every profound spirit a mask is continually growing.

>when you stare into the abyss the abyss stares back at you.

>a dictator divides mankind into two classes: tools and enemies.

To help again with pacing, I decided to add these flashes of events that would show up when the player gathered wood. It added just enough of a draw to keep going though the first part. The first message read: 

>hope she's okay, have to keep the fire going.

**Jul 30, 2013: Back to Battle the Dusty Path**

The quotes were in place (I was so excited about showing this to Michael). I had random room events working too. The after effects created from spending twenty days of wrestling the map on the Dusty Path had worn off. I started specing out the battle sequences now.

**Aug 2, 2013: Had to Take Another Break**

Again. Had to take a break from the Dusty Path. Combat was working at a cursory level... mostly just animations. Combat was pretty much a real time game with a game clock running at 10 frames per second. I'm making a real time game using Cocoa controls as opposed to sprites... kind of felt weird about that. But it worked.

**Aug 7, 2013: Still Trying to Push Through**

5 days on and off to work through the loot screen (the screen that came up after you won a battle). Pixel pushing labels and buttons. At this point I dread any kind of UI work in iOS. 

**Aug 13, 2013: Another Realization That I Was Becoming a Better Developer**

I was scheduled to speak at Austin Code Camp. I was going to do a presentation on an array of front end JavaScript frameworks. I spent the next few days working on the presentation along preparing a lighting talk about how you could use VIM for C# development, and helping one of my friends (Chris Holt), prepare for his presentation on F#. Here I am, 4 months into my "sabbatical". I'm proficient with C#/F#, JavaScript, Objective C, Ruby, VIM, Visual Studio, XCode.

**Aug 25, 2013: Taking a Break to Scratch a NodeJS Itch**

I've spent the last 8 days on the Dusty Path. Adding the Iron Mine, Coal Mine, Sulfur Mine, working through road creation, and working through unlocking workshop items. Needed another break. I spent the next week working on a Twitter mashup written in NodeJS (github.com/amirrjan/sortis).

**Oct 1, 2013: The Play Testing Grind... This is Not Fun**

All of september went to the Dusty Path. Making sure all the different city and town events showed up. Made sure the items unlocked correctly. Made sure map state rolled back on if the player dies. I chatted with Michael about this. How the hell he managed to test all this... He did what I did, just grinded through it T_T. I spent 2 days creating an automated test suite afterwards, that tested all the different random paths the events could take. Glad I did that. Even with all the manual testing, I still had a number of bugs. 

**Oct 19, 2013: A Dusty Path Complete. I Hate You Micheal (in a good way)**

The Dusty Path is finally to a point where all the events work and the ship can be unlocked. I have saving working, a number of my friends and family have play tested the game to this point (and have frankly gotten sick of it...).

During this time period I removed the Nietzche quotes. It just led to confusion to players and the pacing was good enough with the gather wood story line events. Reading all those quotes and picking the ones that fit the atmosphere of the game helped shape the storyline I put in place. Particularly this quote:

>a dictator divides mankind into two classes: tools and enemies.

There was another lull in the game play. The time between buying the compass and then building the smokehouse, tannery, and workshop was still a bit of a wait. This is where I decided to shift the story to take a turn for the worse. Through the creation of these three buildings, the player would slowly see that the villagers were being over worked. And finally, they'd become slaves:

>the villagers...i can see the fatigue in their eyes...
>back breaking labor...the villagers are mine to command...
>leather for finer things, must push the villagers...
>i'll make the villagers work...day and night...they are my slaves...

I've had a number of players literally reset the game at this point. Or simply stop gathering wood because they didn't want their villagers to turn into slaves. I didn't expect this kind of 

I hate you Michael (in a good way). You didn't build a single game. You built 3 games and stitched them together in a brilliant way. The ship scene was the next thing to tackle. There was an end in sight. The largest part of the game was done.

**Oct 23, 2013: Space Sequence Complete. The Meeting With Michael.**

I can't believe it. I have a fully functioning game from begining to end. I knew I had a number of things to polish. But the game was "code complete". Around this time I emailed Michael to set up a video conference (he lives in Canada.. I live in Dallas, TX). I can't believe that all the communication up until this point was done through email and chat. Michael hadn't seen the story line additions I made, I was worried he'd say "no" to the changes. It wasn't a lot of work to rip it out, but it was definitely something I felt that contributed greatly to the experience of A Dark Room. It made the player feel anxious, uneasy, even worried to continue the game at times.

**Oct 30, 2013: Incorporating Feedback After the Meeting**



The app was finally in the App Store. I downloaded it and was able to play it. It was an unreal feeling given how much work was put into the game. I know Michael posted on line. I was hoping that enough people would retweet about the release of the game. It was 6 months since the Hacker News post of A Dark Room, many people would have forgotten about the game by now.

The first reply to the tweet came in. I was sick to my stomach: "The game just crashes, I have an iPhone5S". I screamed at the top of my lungs, broke down, cried on my knees. No one wants to see that on their release day. No one should ever have that happen to them. I tried my wife's iPhone5S and it was crashing there too. I texted my friend Eric Sowell and the game was also crashing for him. A that moment I wished I never spent all that time building the game.


The reaction to the quotes weren't what I expected. It just confused the player. I ended up just speeding up the progress bars and removed the quotes. Fine tuning the begining story sequence was painful, but I'm glad I didn't keep the quotes in (even though I thought it was a cool idea).

There were still pacing issues at the begining. I didn't want people to lose interest. It was the biggest risk to the game. If someone didn't get past the first 85 seconds of the game (the point where the builder wakes up). I knew that I'd get 1 star reviews in the app store stating that the game "didn't do anything".


I pulled myself together and put a debug build of the game on my wife's iPhone. It crashed immediately with a runtime exception (the error itself is a blur now, but I remeber it having to do with compilation flags). My assumption at this point was it had something to do with 64bit architecture of the new iOS devices.

I drove to the Apple Store in Parks and Willowbend and bought and iPad Air to test out my theory. I sat at the food court, took the iPad out. Loaded up the developer certs and deployed a debug build of the app. It crashed there too. I ended up explicitly setting setting the compilation flag to armv7 for all libraries I was referencing. This fixed the debug build.

I repackaged the app and via iTunes Connect, requested an emergency release of the app. They got back to me and approved the emergency release. I pushed up version 1.1 of the app. Then I just had to wait. I was taking part in a NodeJS competition at the time. So that helped keep my mind off of it.

Over the weekend (during the NodeJS competition), I received an email saying that version 1.1 of A Dark Room was ready for sale. That moment, I asked Eric (he was also in the competition) to download the updated version of the app. He started it up, and it worked.

I still have no idea why setting the compilation flag to armv7 worked. But I'm not about to change that now. To this day, it's still extremely stressful deploying to the App Store. I have no idea if the instant crash will come back. I can recreate it using the simulators either.

I created the ADarkRoomiOS twitter handle and start tweeting in the persona of the game. The plan is to interact with as many people as possible who ever tweeted about the web version of the game. Having a daily tweet from the game, shows that I'm not just a random spam bot. That there is a real person behind these tweets.

Nov 15th, 2013:

Courtney Stanton (@q0rt) tweeted about the release of the game. This was a big deal given that it was the first tweet about the game from someone outside of Michael's and my development circles. This tweet also represents the start of following the indie game world more closely. Reports for downloads of the game take a full day to get published in iTunes connect. Seeing this kind of tweet and not knowing the impact right away is nerve wracking.

Nov 18th, 2013:

Using the @ADarkRoomiOS twitter account, I interacted with Leigh Alexander (@leighalexander), an editor at Gamasutra and Kotaku, about a tweet she posted about A Dark Room. Letting a number of people in the conversation about the existence of the iOS version.

Nov 26, 2013:

I updated the support page for A Dark Room to include some back story. The name of the section is "A letter to the fans of A Dark Room". I posted this entry on Hacker News and reddit.com/r/incremental_games to see if it would generate some interest. Again, I ended up hoping against all hope that enough people on Hacker News would remember the Minimal Text Adventure game and show some love. It didn't happen. The response I got on reddit was a bit better. I got quite a few kind words.

Nov 27, 2013:

Cassandra Khaw (@casskhaw), an editor at USGamer, tweets about A Dark Room on iOS.

Dec 17, 2013:

Indie Mega Booth did a full length podcast on A Dark Room. It is incredible when 4 people can talk so long about the game. Just wonderful to hear different interpretations of the story. They mentioned that the iOS version of the game exists. Again, hoping against all odds that the mention of the game would spur more downloads. I took the time to thank Indie Mega Booth for doing the podcast and personally thanked Maddy Myers (@samusclone) on Twitter.... such an awesome Twitter handle by the way.

AppleVis ran a promo code give away. I sent them 10 promocodes to give away and they did something really unique. Instead of just giving them away, they asked individuals got read about the blog post I did on making the game accessibile to the blind and about the making of the game. They had to mention something from the write ups to get a promo code. It was a great idea, and I saw a lot of nice things said about the game.

Reached out to Cara Ellison on twitter about getting A Dark Room infront of people that will write about it. Being the awesome person she is, she replied. I sent over 6 promocodes. The frustrating thing about promocodes is that I don't know if they've been redeemed. I know Cara is extremely busy, and she probably gets many many emails from people trying to pitch her games. I'm just glad that I have someone that can advocate for me.

I dropped the price of A Dark Room by 50% ($0.99). I tweeted about it, a bunch of people tweeted about it. Pocket Tactics wrote up a short peice on the game being half off. 

Reached out to Cassandra Khaw (@CassKhaw) on twitter. Just gave her a heads up that I sent a promo code to USGamers. She favorited the tweet (which is a good thing). I hope it leads to USGamers actually giving the game a shot. Time will tell.

Talked to Karthik about the viability of releasing A Dark Room's source (with an e-book). Trying to think of additional ways to generate income off of this IP. The game isn't making a large amounts of money in the App Store. Every time the game gets a "huge" spike in downloads, it tapers off quickly. I keep thinking to my self "this trend will hold, this trend will hold." But it hasn't done so yet. Karthik also recommended that I reach out to the RubyMotion team and that Laruent Sansoetti is a nice guy and may be able to offer some advice.

Sent an email to the RubyMotion team telling them about the success the game has so far. It was incredible getting a response back so quickly from Laurent Sansonetti and then a tweet that reached a number of developers.

I'm working through the 12,000 lines of RubyMotion presentation and am retroctively writing this log for all points a can remember up until today. Why do I get the feeling I'm enacting that scene from Space Balls where they are fast forwarding through the movie and watching where they are right now?
