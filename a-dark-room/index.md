##A letter to the fans of A Dark Room

I tried to keep this letter spoiler free. If you haven't played the web or mobile version of the game. Please take the time to experience this wonderful journey.

**The History**

A Dark Room for iOS is an official release of the web based version of the game. I worked closely with Michael Townsend to ensure the spirit of the game is captured in a mobile medium. After [quitting my 9-5 job](/meta/2013/07/14/rebooting-life/), this was my first attempt at making something on my own...in delivering software that people enjoy using (as opposed to being just a cog in a corporation).

I came across A Dark Room, June 2013 on Twitter. After playing the game, I knew that this was something important. A work of art. That very same day I contacted Michael Townsend about building a mobile version of this game. Michael, being the awesome dude he is, replied the same day.

>If you want to do a port to iOS, you have my blessings.

A virtual handshake, a snapshot of the source code, 5 months, 70 emails, and 1 video conference later, A Dark Room for iOS shipped.

**The Effort**

A ridiculous amount of work was done to ensure the game's pace transferred well to a mobile device. Literally a 100 hours of hand cramping playthroughs of the game were performed to make sure you would stay engaged. Elements were added to increase the replayability and fun factor. Even a storyline was added to help build a more colorful world in the mind's eye.

I can't reiterate enough how cautious I was in making these changes. It was tough asking friends and family members to play a half baked game. And it was painful to watch every move they made, watch every time they got bored or couldn't figure out what to do. It was especially difficult because each person can only experience the game "for the first time", once. So if there was a miss-step on my part, with regards to the game play or mobile layout, it was a very expensive error.

I was concerned that the changes I made would would ruin the essence of A Dark Room. The absolute last thing I'd ever want is to corrupt the world that the game created. I was very glad that Michael liked the changes and that they were seen as unique experience that complimented the web version.

**The Apology**

I'm glad the game has been well received, for the most part. So far, all the ratings have been 5 stars, except for one. For those that feel the port of the game isn't up to par, I can really only say one thing.

>I'm sorry. From the first day of building the game I wanted to stay true to it. Really. I'm sorry I didn't deliver the experience you were expecting. That wasn't my intention.

If you enjoyed the game. Please, leave us a review in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/a-dark-room/id736683061). 5 stars hopefully.


May the fire burn bright and warm for you. Sincerely,

A Dark Room

**The Rest of the Story**

I want to make sure I an logged of everything that's happend around the growth and popularity of A Dark Room. I hope that indie developers (or those that want to try to "make it" in the App Store) can benefit from these entries. Notable events are listed below along with any pertinent information about how it affected downloads, reviews, and anything else that influnced the success (or failure) of A Dark Room for iOS.

**Jun 29, 2013: Picking the Development Environment**

Starting off I know I didn't want to write this app in Objective C and XCode. I had built a budgeting app using Objective C, Interface Builder and XCode. During my time off, I wanted the experience in building an app using the "recommended" development environment... It was just not fun. I've spent too much time with bloated IDE's and visual designers. I didn't want to experience that again.

My first few lines of A Dark Room code were still in Objective C and XCode. After a day of coding, I got fed up with the environment. I had a copy of RubyMotion sitting on my virtual shelf. I put aside my fears of "using something that isn't supported by Apple", dusted it off, and started building the app in RubyMotion instead.

Coded for 12 hours straight on the game. I haven't had this feeling in a very long time. Losing track of time like that.

**Jul 7, 2013: First Playtest from a Non-Gamer**

I got huts working and had implemented population growth. The game was far from complete. But I took the chance and showed it to a non gamer. The were throughly confused. But slowly got pulled into the game and had built "a tiny village". I consistently heard "it needs pictures, it needs visuals". I actually thought about adding black and white background images to the game that would change as the player progressed. But I wanted to have a complete game before adding my own creativity to it.

**Jul 8, 2013: Realization That I was Growing as a Developer**

Working on the game while at the same time preparing for an Austin .Net user group presantation on using the dynamic capabilities of C#. It's really interesting being proficient in multiple languages now. It's a perspective thats hard to describe. The presentation went well and I was making good progress in flushing out the game.

**Jul 11, 2013: Realization That I Enjoy Helping Others Break Down Barriers**

Did another presentation on ASP.NET MVC web development using the dynamic capabilities of C#. I'd say that this Dallas .Net User Group presentation was the best presentation I've ever done. The turn out was huge (120+ people). I was presenting on ideas I cared about. I was trying to break down barriers for developers, and sharing techniques/workflows to development that just simply aren't practiced on the .Net stack. I hope I showed enough good things about fast feedback loops (out of proc build and deploys, fast test feedback), low friction workflows (command line centric actions)... the Visual Studio IDE and Microsoft created frameworks... just don't seem to value these ideas as much. I see it more now given all the work I've now done using NodeJS, JavaScript, Rails, and Ruby Motion.

**Jul 12, 2013: The First Road Block in Developing A Dark Room**

I hit my first road block. When I reached out to Michael about porting the game to iOS, I actually hadn't finished playing the web version. I never bought the compass to set out on to the Dusty Path. I thought I was making extremely good progress, but then I saw the complexity of the outside world. The economy management was just the tip of the iceberg. The size of the Dusty Path was also a challenge to fit on a tiny screen. It took me 10 days to figure out how to approach the next part of the game. I made tiny sample apps and tried different variations of pinch and zoom techniques, scrolling techniques, "follow the player" techniques, and skeumorphic stuff. Before this day I thought I was so close to finishing the implementation of game....

**Jul 21, 2013: I Want to Stab Cocoa UI In the Face**

I settled on a "follow the player" implemenation where the map would center when the player moved on the map. You could scroll around the map if you needed, but as soon as you moved again, it would refocus to your current location. I had to use two layers of overlapping labels to represent landmarks and terrain (Cocoa UILabels can only have one format). It took 5 days to get the labels lined up and scrolling correctly. Twenty days, just gone on trying to display a map...

**Jul 26, 2013: Making the iOS Version my Own**

At this point I needed to take a break from the Dusty Path and do some polish and play testing. The pacing in the game was an issue. It was too slow to get started. I didn't know if it was because I had played it so many times or if the game was actually just too slow to get going on a mobile medium.

I decided to add Friedrich Nietzsche quotes that would show up randomly when you stoked the fire (to help with the slower points in the game). This didn't make it into the final release, but were in the game for a while. I had accumulated 200 quotes and felt that it was inline with the atmosphere of the game.

**Jul 28, 2013: Creativity is a Drug**

I don't know what it was about these Nietzche quotes. I think it was my first attempt at doing something different and creative... something that set this version apart from the web version. I spent the day incorporating quotes, thinking to myself how awesome it would be and how erie it would make the game. Here are some of them:

>every profound spirit needs a mask: even more, around every profound spirit a mask is continually growing.

>when you stare into the abyss the abyss stares back at you.

>a dictator divides mankind into two classes: tools and enemies.

To help again with pacing, I decided to add these flashes of events that would show up when the player gathered wood. It added just enough of a draw to keep going though the first part. The first message read: 

>hope she's okay, have to keep the fire going.

**Jul 30, 2013: Back to Battle the Dusty Path**

The quotes were in place (I was so excited about showing this to Michael). I had random room events working too. The after effects created from spending twenty days of wrestling the map on the Dusty Path had worn off. I started specing out the battle sequences now.

**Aug 1, 2013: Reflecting on the .Net Ecosystem - The Microsoft Manifesto**

I haven't booted up Windows for a long period of time at this point. Most of my time was spent building A Dark Room on OSX. I still built small applications and kept my skills sharp with NodeJS, Rails. I still paired with developers on any stack (.Net or not), and I still went to .Net User Groups to meet up with friends.

But at this point I just had some (for lack of a better term) "resentment" with the .Net ecosystem. I've spent a good amount of time "on the other side" and have tried really really hard to break down barriers for .Net developers. But I just didn't seem to be making any progress. So I took the day and wrote a blog entry about it: [The Microsoft Manifesto](http://amirrajan.net/meta/2013/08/01/the-microsoft-manifesto/).

**Aug 2, 2013: Had to Take Another Break**

Again. Had to take a break from the Dusty Path. Combat was working at a cursory level... mostly just animations. Combat was pretty much a real time game with a game clock running at 10 frames per second. I'm making a real time game using Cocoa controls as opposed to sprites... kind of felt weird about that. But it worked.

**Aug 7, 2013: Still Trying to Push Through**

5 days on and off to work through the loot screen (the screen that came up after you won a battle). Pixel pushing labels and buttons. At this point I dread any kind of UI work in iOS. 

**Aug 13, 2013: Another Realization That I Was Becoming a Better Developer**

I was scheduled to speak at Austin Code Camp. I was going to do a presentation on an array of front end JavaScript frameworks. I spent the next few days working on the presentation along preparing a lighting talk about how you could use VIM for C# development, and helping one of my friends (Chris Holt), prepare for his presentation on F#. Here I am, 4 months into my "sabbatical". I'm proficient with C#/F#, JavaScript, Objective C, Ruby, VIM, Visual Studio, XCode.

**Aug 25, 2013: Taking a Break to Scratch a NodeJS Itch**

I've spent the last 8 days on the Dusty Path. Adding the Iron Mine, Coal Mine, Sulfur Mine, working through road creation, and working through unlocking workshop items. Needed another break. I spent the next week working on a Twitter mashup written in NodeJS (github.com/amirrjan/sortis).

**Sep 19, 2013: .Net OSS is DOA**

Development of the game continues. Grinding through the play testing and the Dusty Path. I was just a grumpy person this month in general. I spent some time reflecting on all the different things I've done on my sabbatacal. A Dark Room had been my primary "work" through out this time. But I continued to spend time working with other stacks. After seeing these other development environments.

Another internal struggle with .Net development. I've tried to have discourse on twitter with a number of .Net devs. I built a twitter mashup to help me manage that discourse because I was having so many conversations at once. At this point I've learned (or at least gotten better) at objective analyzing risk and reward. Using NodeJS and Ruby Motion, I have now have a better understanding of what OSS _really_ looks like. So I put another blog post up: [.Net OSS is DOA](http://amirrajan.net/meta/2013/09/19/perception-is-reality-dot-net-oss/). This one got some attention. I wanted to (again) help developers break down barriers and see that all the "answers" don't exist in any single stack. This again was me venting. I was berated by my peers. I was "just plain wrong", that it was "just an opinion", and that "I was sorely misguided". "Here we go again with all the .Net OSS stuff". I felt labeled as just some dude with a lot of angst. I wish I never wrote this blog entry.

**Sep 25, 2013: I'm Done Debating With Expert .Net Developers and Dealing With the .Net Mono Culture**

Another heated debate on Twitter. This time with regards to test driven development and behavior driven development. I now understand the term "strong opinons, strongly held". At this point, I knew I was done debating with experts of the .Net stack. They have formed and solified their opinons about "how things should be done". So I'm done trying to be respected/acknowledged by these individuals. The only result from all this discourse is that it took away from helping those devs that are open to change. I've wasted my breath too many times trying to get these guru's to see that they don't have it all figured out (no one has it all figured out, and you're selling yourself short if you think you do).

I didn't write a "Farewell .Net" blog post. It would have been a waste of my breath. 

**Oct 1, 2013: The Play Testing Grind... This is Not Fun**

All of september went to the Dusty Path. Making sure all the different city and town events showed up. Made sure the items unlocked correctly. Made sure map state rolled back on if the player dies. I chatted with Michael about this. How the hell he managed to test all this... He did what I did, just grinded through it T_T. I spent 2 days creating an automated test suite afterwards, that tested all the different random paths the events could take. Glad I did that. Even with all the manual testing, I still had a number of bugs. 

**Oct 19, 2013: A Dusty Path Complete. I Hate You Micheal (in a good way)**

The Dusty Path is finally to a point where all the events work and the ship can be unlocked. I have saving working, a number of my friends and family have play tested the game to this point (and have frankly gotten sick of it...).

During this time period I removed the Nietzche quotes. It just led to confusion to players and the pacing was good enough with the gather wood story line events. Reading all those quotes and picking the ones that fit the atmosphere of the game helped shape the storyline I put in place. Particularly this quote:

>a dictator divides mankind into two classes: tools and enemies.

There was another lull in the game play. The time between buying the compass and then building the smokehouse, tannery, and workshop was still a bit of a wait. This is where I decided to shift the story to take a turn for the worse. Through the creation of these three buildings, the player would slowly see that the villagers were being over worked. And finally, they'd become slaves:

>the villagers...i can see the fatigue in their eyes...
>back breaking labor...the villagers are mine to command...
>leather for finer things, must push the villagers...
>i'll make the villagers work...day and night...they are my slaves...

I've had a number of players literally reset the game at this point. Or simply stop gathering wood because they didn't want their villagers to turn into slaves. I didn't expect this kind of 

I hate you Michael (in a good way). You didn't build a single game. You built 3 games and stitched them together in a brilliant way. The ship scene was the next thing to tackle. There was an end in sight. The largest part of the game was done.

**Oct 23, 2013: Space Sequence Complete. The Meeting With Michael.**

I can't believe it. I have a fully functioning game from begining to end. I knew I had a number of things to polish. But the game was "code complete". Around this time I emailed Michael to set up a video conference (he lives in Canada.. I live in Dallas, TX). I can't believe that all the communication up until this point was done through email and chat. Michael hadn't seen the story line additions I made, I was worried he'd say "no" to the changes. It wasn't a lot of work to rip it out, but it was definitely something I felt that contributed greatly to the experience of A Dark Room. It made the player feel anxious, uneasy, even worried to continue the game at times.

This is a testimant to how awesome and billiant Michael is. He appreciated the changes I made to the story line, and loved the enhancements I made to the mobile version of the game. It was as simple as that. He just said "that's awesome!". Suffice to say that a huge weight was lifted off of my shoulders. We got to talking infact about the intriciacies of the game. I mentioned that most of the game could have been played without any villagers if Iron, Coal and Sulphur could be mined by the player. Michael said "Hey, why don't you add that? Add a solo mode with an alternate ending?"

**Oct 30, 2013: Incorporating Feedback After the Meeting**

The primary feedback that I got was removal of pronouns. I didn't realize it, but no part of the game referred to the player as "you" or "I" or "us". I also incorporated the solo mode and alternate ending to the game. Play testing. Play testing. More play testing. More tweaking. More play testing.

**Oct 31, 2013: My Wife's Final Play Test**

The game is in its final form. My wife sits down and plays the game for the 50th time. A number of my friends play tested the game. But I really didn't want to ask too much of them. Most of them only play tested the game onces at different points. I was able to get feedback from them, and they were a tremendous help (thank you Jason Smith, Zahan Tariq, Eric Sowell, Tim Rayburn, and Chris Holt). But my wife stands well above all the others that play tested. She could have said she was tired of playing this game at any point, but she didn't. She was the only person that, without hesitation, would play through the game any time I asked. I handed the final game to her at 10 pm that night. And she played the game non stop, all they way to the end. It was 2 am when she completed the play through. Thank you my dear.

**Nov 1, 2013: Submitted to the App Store at $1.99**

I submitted the game to the App Store. The description of the game was set to "a text based journey... awake. head throbbing. vision blurry." I still spent a day making minor tweeks to balancing. I play tested the game another 4 times before releasing. My game times were pretty damn fast at this point because I new exactly what to do. I could beat the game in 90 to 100 minutes without even thinking too hard. Now I just have to wait. This was a good week. A huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. And I was no preparing for a NodeJS competition. Node Knockout 2013!

**Nov 8, 2013: One of the Worst Days of My Life**

It took a full 7 days. But A Dark Room was finally in the App Store. I downloaded it and was able to play it. It was an unreal feeling given how much work was put into the game. I know Michael tweeted about the release. I was hoping that enough people would retweet about the release of the game. It was 6 months since the Hacker News post of A Dark Room, many people would have forgotten about the game by now.

The first reply to the tweet came in. I was sick to my stomach: "The game just crashes, I have an iPhone5S". I screamed at the top of my lungs, broke down, literally fell to my knees and cried. No one wants to see that on their release day. No one should ever have that happen to them. I tried my wife's iPhone5S and it was crashing there too. I texted my friend Eric Sowell and the game was also crashing for him. A that moment I wished I never spent all that time building the game.

I pulled myself together and put a debug build of the game on my wife's iPhone. It crashed immediately with a runtime exception (the error itself is a blur now, but I remeber it having to do with compilation flags). My assumption at this point was it had something to do with 64bit architecture of the new iOS devices.

I drove to the Apple Store in Parks and Willowbend and bought and iPad Air to test out my theory. I sat at the food court, took the iPad out. Loaded up the developer certs and deployed a debug build of the app. It crashed there too. I ended up explicitly setting setting the compilation flag to armv7 for all libraries I was referencing. This fixed the debug build.

I repackaged the app and via iTunes Connect, requested an emergency release of the app. They got back to me and approved the emergency release. I pushed up version 1.1 of the app. Then I just had to wait. I was taking part in a NodeJS competition at the time. So that helped keep my mind off of it.

**Nov 9, 2013: The Crash Fix Shipped**

Over the weekend (during the NodeJS competition), I received an email saying that version 1.1 of A Dark Room was ready for sale. That moment, I asked Eric (he was also in the competition) to download the updated version of the app. He started it up, and it worked.

I still have no idea why setting the compilation flag to armv7 worked. But I'm not about to change that now. To this day, it's still extremely stressful deploying to the App Store. I have no idea if the instant crash will come back. I can recreate it using the simulators either.

Our Node Knockout 2013 team: Team Us - As in "us" not "them", ended up placing 15th overall and placed 6th in the fun/utility category. We built a game called [NodeKick](http://github.com/amirrajan/nodekic). It was awesome an awesome experience.

**Nov 10, 2013: My Obsession with Twitter and @ADarkRoomiOS Begins**

I created the ADarkRoomiOS twitter handle and start tweeting in the persona of the game. The plan is to interact with as many people as possible who ever tweeted about the web version of the game. Having a daily tweet from the game, shows that I'm not just a random spam bot. That there is a real person behind these tweets. I did a Twitter search for "adarkroom" and began combing through all the tweets. Replying to anyone who mentioned the game. Letting them know that there was an iOS version.

**Nov 15, 2013: A Ray of Hope - [Courtney Stanton (@q0rt)](http://superopinionated.com/)**

I've spent 5 days putting up daily tweets about A Dark Room. Reached out a few people on twitter in the persona of the game. It was fun. I got a couple of laughs and some people actually interacted with me too. I liked building a relationship with the fans :-). Every single morning I'd wake up and check the downloads of A Dark Room for iOS. They were abysmal. Only 5 to 10 downloads a day. It's such a let down. Such a beautiful game, and no one is downloading it.

Courtney Stanton (@q0rt) tweeted about the release of the game. This was a big deal given that it was the first tweet about the game from someone outside of Michael's and my development circles. Courtney also had large following on twitter.

This tweet also represents a window into the indie game world. I started following this community more closely. Reports for downloads of the game take a full day to get published in iTunes connect. Seeing this kind of tweet and not knowing the impact right away is nerve wracking.

**Nov 16, 2013: A Rude Awakening**

I woke up the next morning, awake, head throbbing, vision blurry. In a sleepy stupor, I logged into iTunes Connect and saw the number of downloads because of Courtney's tweet. It spiked to 30. Thirty downloads... a tweet sent to over 3000 people... and it lead to only 30 downloads.

**Nov 18, 2013: More Notable Interactions**

Using the @ADarkRoomiOS twitter account, I interacted with Leigh Alexander (@leighalexander), an editor at Gamasutra and Kotaku, about a tweet she posted about A Dark Room. Letting a number of people in the conversation about the existence of the iOS version. There was no noticable difference in downloads the next day. A meager 5 downloads... on the 19th. I'm glad I was able to interact a meaningful interaction with Leigh however.

**Nov 22, 2013: Pocket Gamers writes an Entry on A Dark Room**

I added "search on Google for any mention of A Dark Room" to my routine. I came [Take a risk on iOS adventure game A Dark Room and you might have a new addiction](http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPad/A+Dark+Room/news.asp?c=55477). This review written by Chris Preistman (@CPriestman), is the first review of A Dark Room iOS that I've come accross. How freaking cool is that? Unsolicited reviews are starting to come up. A spike to 30 downloads happen that day.

**Nov 23, 2013: A Dark Room Forum Entry on Touch Arcade**

https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/142824665d6ee667

**Nov 24, 2013: The First One Star Review**

The game up to this point has had 245 downloads over an 18 day period (that's 13 downloads a day). I had a a few 5 star reviews from friends in the development community. But I recieved my first (legitimant) 1 star review:

>What was a simple and elegant game should not have been messed with. I regret spending $2 on such a mess. Not only is the UI counter-intuitive and clumsy, but the mobile designer took far too much creative license in altering the original statistics and proportions put in place by Michael Townsend, original designer. Additionally, there is a bug that results in permanent thieves with no way to deter them, making the game essentially unplayable.

What do I do? I played through the game hundereds of times. Meticulously place every button, every interaction. There was no bug in the theives, I checked 10 times to make sure (just impatience on the part of the player and unlucking random number generation). One bad review of sets 100 good ones. To this day I feel the pains of this review. I see it as incredible brutal. Empathy was something I've learned through this time period. I understood how frustrating is to pay for an app and get delievered "shit". So I apologized. I have no idea if blewis1234 will ever read anything on this page. But I hope at some point, he'll re-rate the game.

**Nov 26, 2013: Game Back Story, an Apology, and a Post to Hacker News**

I updated the support page for A Dark Room to include some back story. The name of the section is "A letter to the fans of A Dark Room". I posted this entry on Hacker News and reddit.com/r/incremental_games to see if it would generate some interest. Again, I ended up hoping against all hope that enough people on Hacker News would remember the Minimal Text Adventure game and show some love. It didn't happen. The response I got on reddit was a bit better. I got quite a few kind words, which helped heal the wounds of my first one star review. The next morning, because of the post to reddit, the game downloads spiked to 27 downloads. 

**Nov 27, 2013: Another Notable Tweet. A Stellar Video Review.**

Cassandra Khaw (@casskhaw), an editor at USGamer, tweets about A Dark Room on iOS. Again because of an interaction from @ADarkRoomiOS. I'm getting more involved in the indie gamer community. Courtney, Leigh, and Cassandra are all people that @ADarkRoomiOS (and by extension I) follow. That day the downloads spiked to 45. The largest single day download for A Dark Room iOS. The download trend didn't last. Every time I think the download trend will hold, it doesn't.

I also came across a video review Chris Charlton (@reasonjp) did on the [iOS version of the game](http://kaijupop.com/2013/11/iospc-quick-vid-dark-room/). It was an incredible review, and I truely made my day. This small wins help me get through each disappointment in the number of downloads.

**Dec 10, 2013: Blind Gamers Are Playing A Dark Room**

I number of blind people reached out to @ADarkRoomiOS twitter handle: Orinks (a member of AppleVis) and Aaron (a member of AudioGames.net). I was in complete utter shock that blind people were trying to play A Dark Room. I sent out a promise to them that I'd make the game accessible to the blind. Fired up RubyMotion and started researching what it would take to make A Dark Room fully playable via VoiceOver.

**Dec 16, 2013: [Cara Ellison (@Carachan1)](http://caraellison.co.uk/) - Another Glimmer of Hope for A Dark Room**

Cara Ellison a writer for a number of online gaming website mentioned putting A Dark Room on her 2013 Game of the Year list. I reached out to here hoping she would have some kind words to write about the iOS version. I emailed her a promo code that day. Again, these moments are hard to put in words. It's a chance for all the hard work Michael and I have put into the game to possibly pay off. For A Dark Room to finally make it into the lime lite.

**Dec 17, 2013: Indie Mega Booth Does A Podcast on A Dark Room**

Indie Mega Booth did a full length podcast on A Dark Room. It is incredible when 4 people can talk so long about the game. Just wonderful to hear different interpretations of the story. They mentioned that the iOS version of the game exists. Again, hoping against all odds that the mention of the game would spur more downloads. I took the time to thank Indie Mega Booth for doing the podcast and personally thanked Maddy Myers (@samusclone) on Twitter.... such an awesome Twitter handle by the way.

**Jan 19, 2013: Apple Vis Promo Code Give Away**

AppleVis ran a promo code give away. I sent them 10 promocodes to give away and they did something really unique. Instead of just giving them away, they asked individuals got read about the blog post I did on making the game accessibile to the blind and about the making of the game. They had to mention something from the write ups to get a promo code. It was a great idea, and I saw a lot of nice things said about the game.

**Feb 7, 2013: A Hail Mary To Cara Ellison**

Reached out to Cara Ellison on twitter about getting A Dark Room infront of people that will write about it. Being the awesome person she is, she replied. I sent over 6 promocodes. The frustrating thing about promocodes is that I don't know if they've been redeemed. I know Cara is extremely busy, and she probably gets many many emails from people trying to pitch her games. I'm just glad that I have someone that can advocate for me.

**Feb 24, 2013: Reaching Out to RubyMotion**

Talked to Karthik about the viability of releasing A Dark Room's source (with an e-book). Trying to think of additional ways to generate income off of this IP. The game isn't making a large amounts of money in the App Store. Every time the game gets a "huge" spike in downloads, it tapers off quickly. I keep thinking to my self "this trend will hold, this trend will hold." But it hasn't done so yet. Karthik also recommended that I reach out to the RubyMotion team and that Laruent Sansoetti is a nice guy and may be able to offer some advice.

Sent an email to the RubyMotion team telling them about the success the game has so far. It was incredible getting a response back so quickly from Laurent Sansonetti and then a tweet that reached a number of developers.
