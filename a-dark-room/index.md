##A letter to the fans of A Dark Room

I tried to keep this letter spoiler free. If you haven't played the web or mobile version of the game. Please take the time to experience this wonderful journey.

**The History**

A Dark Room for iOS is an official release of the web based version of the game. I worked closely with Michael Townsend to ensure the spirit of the game is captured in a mobile medium. After [quitting my 9-5 job](/meta/2013/07/14/rebooting-life/), this was my first attempt at making something on my own...in delivering software that people enjoy using (as opposed to being just a cog in a corporation).

I came across A Dark Room, June 2013 on Twitter. After playing the game, I knew that this was something important. A work of art. That very same day I contacted Michael Townsend about building a mobile version of this game. Michael, being the awesome dude he is, replied the same day.

>If you want to do a port to iOS, you have my blessings.

A virtual handshake, a snapshot of the source code, 5 months, 70 emails, and 1 video conference later, A Dark Room for iOS shipped.

**The Effort**

A ridiculous amount of work was done to ensure the game's pace transferred well to a mobile device. Literally a 100 hours of hand cramping playthroughs of the game were performed to make sure you would stay engaged. Elements were added to increase the replayability and fun factor. Even a storyline was added to help build a more colorful world in the mind's eye.

I can't reiterate enough how cautious I was in making these changes. It was tough asking friends and family members to play a half baked game. And it was painful to watch every move they made, watch every time they got bored or couldn't figure out what to do. It was especially difficult because each person can only experience the game "for the first time", once. So if there was a miss-step on my part, with regards to the game play or mobile layout, it was a very expensive error.

I was concerned that the changes I made would would ruin the essence of A Dark Room. The absolute last thing I'd ever want is to corrupt the world that the game created. I was very glad that Michael liked the changes and that they were seen as unique experience that complimented the web version.

**The Apology**

I'm glad the game has been well received, for the most part. So far, all the ratings have been 5 stars, except for one. For those that feel the port of the game isn't up to par, I can really only say one thing.

>I'm sorry. From the first day of building the game I wanted to stay true to it. Really. I'm sorry I didn't deliver the experience you were expecting. That wasn't my intention.

If you enjoyed the game. Please, leave us a review in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/a-dark-room/id736683061). 5 stars hopefully.
