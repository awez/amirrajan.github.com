Hey there!

If I replied with a link to this page, it means that you sent me a message (most likely an email) with regards to employment.

The message you sent me was probably missing things from the checklist below.

Please keep these things in mind before sending me future employment opportunities:

- I don't have any interest in salary positions.
- I'm definitely open to W2 hourly, corp to corp, or 1099.
- My bill rate is a _firm_ $150 an hour (no PTO/medical benefits needed).
- I will not relocate, but am open for up to 25% travel. I'm located in Dallas, Texas.
- You can go [here](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/amirrajan) for my resume. Just print to PDF (much more portable than Word documents).
- You are currently on my web-site. Feel free to visit the [About](/about) page for more information about who I am, and what expertise I can offer your company.

Hope this list helps you out! I look forward to hearing about opportunities that _fit the criteria above_.

Truly, I'm always looking for good recruiters to work with. This is just a quick way to separate the spammers
from the ones that are genuinely interested in building a relationship with me.

We both have our hands full with work, family, and life. Time is precious. Given this, I'm sure you can empathize with this next statement:

_If you spent even a single minute searching online to see if I had a
blog, you would have found this page, and may not have wasted your own
time sending me one of your templated emails. If I get another message
from you that doesn't take into consideration the list above, I'll
just mark you as spam/junk. Don't waste my time and I won't waste
yours._

Sincerely,

Amir Rajan
