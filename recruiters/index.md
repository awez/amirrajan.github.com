Hey there!

If I replied with a link to this page, it means that you sent me a
message (most likely an email) with regards to employment.

The message you sent me was probably missing things from the checklist below.

Please keep these things in mind before sending me future employment opportunities:

- Talk to me about Clojure/ClojureScript and NodeJS/React positions.
- I'm looking for W2 hourly, corp to corp, or 1099 based work (not
  currently looking for salary positions).
- You can go [here](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/amirrajan) for my
  resume. Just print to PDF (much more portable than Word documents).
- You are currently on my website. Feel free to visit the
  [About](/about) page for more information about who I am, and what
  expertise I can offer your company.

Hope this list helps you out! I look forward to hearing about opportunities that fit the criteria above.

Truly, **I'm always looking for good recruiters to work with**. This is just a quick way to separate the spammers
from the ones that are genuinely interested in building a relationship.

Sincerely,

Amir Rajan
