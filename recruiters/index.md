Hey there!

If I replied with a link to this page, it means that you sent me a message (most likely an email) with regards to employment.

The message you sent me was probably missing things from the checklist below.

Please keep these things in mind before sending me future employment opportunities:

- Talk to me about Clojure/ClojureScript and NodeJS/React positions.
- I don't have any interest in salary positions.
- I'm definitely open to W2 hourly, corp to corp, or 1099.
- My bill rate is $200 an hour (I don't need benefits/PTO).
- I'm open to 50% travel (located in Dallas, Texas).
- You can go [here](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/amirrajan) for my resume. Just print to PDF (much more portable than Word documents).
- You are currently on my website. Feel free to visit the [About](/about) page for more information about who I am, and what expertise I can offer your company.

Hope this list helps you out! I look forward to hearing about opportunities that _fit the criteria above_.

Truly, **I'm always looking for good recruiters to work with**. This is just a quick way to separate the spammers
from the ones that are genuinely interested in building a relationship.

Sincerely,

Amir Rajan
