Hey there!

If I replied with a with a link to this page, it means that you sent me a message (most likely an email) with regards to employement.

The message you sent me was probably missing things from the checklist below.

Please keep these things in mind before sending me future employment opportunities:

- I don't have any interest in salary positions.
- I'm definitely open to W2 hourly, corp to corp, or 1099.
- My bill rate is a _firm_ $150 an hour (no PTO/medical benefits needed).
- I will not relocate, but am open for up to 25% travel. I'm located in Dallas, Texas.
- You can go [here](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/amirrajan) for my resume. Just print to PDF (much more portible than Word documents).
- You are currently on my website. Feel free to visit the [About](/about) page for more information about who I am, and what expertise I can offer your company.

Hope this list helps you out! I look forward to hearing about opportunities that _fit the criteria above_.

Sincerely,

Amir Rajan
