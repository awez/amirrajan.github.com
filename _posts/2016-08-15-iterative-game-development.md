## tl;dr; ##

I started working on a new game called
[A Noble Circle](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/a-noble-circle/id977865620)
back in February of 2015. I was doing contract work at the time during
the weekdays, so I was only able to work on my [Flatland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland) inspired
work during the weekends. **I didn't want to spin my wheels in an echo
chamber so I decided to release a barely playable version and iterate
on it "publicly".** I've made $12,000 in revenue so far. The game
_still_ isn't done (and yet I'm still making money off of it). Next
time you feel like your game isn't "ready", go ahead and release it
and see what happens. You may be surprised at the results. _I ended up
creating feature/mechanics I would have never thought of doing if it
weren't for the public feedback that people were giving me._ Your
mileage may vary of course (this seems to be working for me on
mobile).

# Timeline #

## First Release ##

First commit was on February 26, 2015. First release was on March
30, 2015. That's _one month_ guys and gals. I just wanted to get
something out there, anything, just to see how it would be
received. Here are the metrics for first release:

    --------------------------------------------------

    --------------------------------------------------
       10            177             17            908
    --------------------------------------------------

[Here is a gameplay video of the very first release of my terrible game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gz-8TYvt5c). It's
a rhythm based game with pretty terrible hit boxes and very very
rudimentary jump mechanics. But hey, _I got something out there
dammit_.

The game was set to free at the time. The App Store description talked
about what I was planning to do with the game, and that this was an
early preview (which I'd start charging for once I felt it was worth
the $0.99).

In addition to the App Store description. I added developer logs to
the very end of this very very short game. I talk about how the App
Store is broken and what I'm trying to do. It was well
received. People were forgiving about the poor gameplay and terrible
hit boxes because they _knew_ that another update was coming. _I think
it's important to have this kind of developer commentary at the end of
your games. As an indie game dev, personal connection is one of the
few things that gives us an edge over AAA game companies. So take some
time to internalize what you are bringing to the table with your
games/brand and make sure the people that download your game know who
you are and what you are trying to do._

Aside: I compensated for A Noble Circle being free by putting an
interstitial to my other game (A Dark Room). If anything I could
potentially get some impressions/downloads for paid games that I
already have out there. Never underestimate the power of
interstitials.

## Second Release ##

Second release was April 5, 2015. _Six days_ after the first release.

    --------------------------------------------------

[Here is a gameplay
video of release two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrgdJm2ifM). I made a minor
usability change to tapping on the screen. Also, Instead of placeholder
boxes for enemies, I now have geometric shapes that better depict the
inhabitants of flatland. **I felt the sex scene was particularly funny.**

## Third Release ##

Third release was on April 25, 2015 (less than a month from the last
release). I was getting a bit of feedback via App Store reviews saying
the the jump mechanic was a little confusing. _This is important. I'm
getting feedback from people who enjoy the direction of the game and
want to see improvements._ Just releasing the game publicly is a lot
easier to do than managing beta testers/private beta (that and you get
a fresh pair of eyes as new people give the game a shot).

    files          blank        comment           code

    --------------------------------------------------

[Here is a gameplay of release three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upZLLUSC1GU). So
I added a small halo effect showing that the circle was ready to
jump again. My hit boxes are better and there was more storyline
added. This was another an important part of why this approach
ended up working for me: _There was always some visible changes
and some additional storyline that kept people coming back to see
what changed._ And with each update, people left reviews stating
that they liked the direction (or hated it). People were slowly
getting invested in the story of the circle and my story as an
indie game developer. With each update, I also tried to include
more developer logs so that people would attempt to reach the end.

## Fourth Release ##

Forth release was on May 10, 2015. There was a ton of refactoring I
did underneath the scene, so storyline changes were small, but I added
a really really hard section to the game to compensate (you'll see me die multiple
times in the video because of it).


    --------------------------------------------------
    files          blank        comment           code
    --------------------------------------------------
       30            333             14           2034
    --------------------------------------------------

[Here is the gameplay video for the fourth
release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ9H_l1OXOI). This release
also made it a lot easier for people to click the interstitial for A
Dark Room. At this point I had a lot of long developer commentary
too. So having a means to "teleport" to different sections of the game
was good for the players (and it turned out that it helped me too with
regards to debugging).

It's also worth noting that my composer partner would slate new music
to be released if I needed a month worth of weekends to refactor
things and keep the code from becoming a ball of mud. So even though
the majority of this release was rewiring _the player still got new
things (in this case a new musical score)._

## Fifth Release ##

Fifth release was on May 26, 2015. An interesting outcome
occurred with this "pressure" of release monthly. I had reviews talking
about how difficult that last part I added was (they also mentioned it was totally worth
it to hear the new piece of music). To alleviate the pains that the new
section created, I added the ability to "zoom out" and see more of the
stage. This was something that was _a reaction to what I previously
put out in an attempt to "fix" the hard part to the game, but it turned out to be an integral
part of my game (a means to show the player that a difficult part was
coming up)._

    --------------------------------------------------

[Here is the gameplay video for the fifth release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RUgSSbyhOA). You
can see the "cool" zoom feature during that hard part from the last
video. I used it for story progression too. On top of that, the player
received another "vista" in the form of more music. I feel this is
worth reiterating: _for this "public" development approach to work,
every release has to have something visibly different. Something that
gets the player to come back and check out what's changed._

## Sixth Release ##

It was crunch time at work, so I couldn't develop for a long long
while. This release came out August 30, 2015 (three months since the
last release). I had some major updates to make to A Dark Room and The
Ensign during this time period too. So I just had to put ANC on the
back burner.

June is when I felt that the game was worth purchasing. I set the
price to $0.99 and decided to see what would happen (a full breakdown of
revenue and downloads is at the end). I also ended up pushing for A
Dark Room to get featured (given the recent updates I made). ADR's
feature helped the sales of A Noble Circle. Given I had to update A
Dark Room and The Ensign anyways, I took the opportunity to put an
interstitial for A Noble Circle in both games.

    --------------------------------------------------

[Here is the gameplay video for the sixth release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwIaDC9ApPU). People
were _still_ complaining about the jump mechanic and that it was
confusing. So I attempted to solve that problem by adding a "how to"
image. Turns out that these images were also a great way to tell the
story (they ended up serving as additional "vistas" too). _It really
was beautiful seeing the evolution in public like this/incorporating
the feedback of the players. I still wonder today if the "zoom out"
mechanic or the custom drawings that I did would have been there if it
weren't for this approach in development._

Aside: During this time crunch period, developing on A Noble Circle
ended up being centered around drawing and storyline as opposed to new
game mechanics. I really love drawing and this was a means to scratch
that itch (this is also why game development as a creative outlet is
so wonderful). If you're interested in how I go about sketching all this
stuff, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G8fNyLR3Nw)
and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWBCGitjyCE) where I
use an iPad Pro and Pencil (if you can shell out the $1,500 for the
device and stylus, do it, it's totally worth it).

## Seventh Release ##

The seventh release went out on September 28, 2015. People were
_STILL_ complaining about the jump mechanic. So I added a tutorial
section, plus changed the mechanic so that you didn't have a "cool
down" to jump again. **This was _the_ change that needed to be made, I felt like the game's
musicality opened up by removing the "cool down" on the jump. This turning point
in the game mechanic came _eight_ months into development. One that I
wouldn't have figured out if it weren't for the feedback I was getting
through the reviews.**

Around this time I also ended up releasing [A Noble Circle -
Prologue](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/a-noble-circle-prologue/id1033044184?mt=8). This
was a free version of the game with a limited story (I still
included the developer commentary and the end to encourage them to buy
the full game).

    --------------------------------------------------

[Here is a gameplay video for the seventh
release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p90yJX7c2vA). With this
release, I felt the game was good enough to pitch to Apple for a
feature. _Taking this iterative approach to development gives me many
more opportunities to get featured. With every new update, I can ping
Apple and tell them about all the new cool stuff I added._ Through out
the 12 to 15 months of updates, Apple has featured A Noble Circle many
many times (something I feel wouldn't have happened if I just released
the game "once").

## The Eight Release ##

The eight release came out on January 1, 2016. People were _STILL_
complaining about the jump mechanic. So I made one final change to how
the circle moved (I removed the side to side acceleration of the
circle and made it a constant speed), and it made a world of
difference. From here, the engine of the game was complete and all
that was left was storyline/content creation. I had to take another
break from releasing ANC. I came down with "walking pneumonia" back in
December, plus holiday season and crunch time at work kept me from
working on it.

After all that was over, I was then dealing with porting A Dark Room
to Android (my contract was ending so I needed to make sure I had
additional income coming in... sometimes you have to put the creative
side of game development down and just survive).

    --------------------------------------------------

[Here is the eighth release showing the game engine as it exists
today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deZXQPcm1tg). There were some
minor changes with regards to particle effects and camera movement,
but the jump mechanic was (finally) _perfect_. This was also when I
moved over to using sprites as opposed to drawing vector shapes (I
love my iPad Pro and Pencil).

[This video shows the musicality of the game using the "final" engine with multijumps and constant circle movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKJrsMqVugU)
(before I added the sprites in).

## More Takeaways ##

- Building the game in public let me feel good every time I did a release.
- The pressure of adding "all the things" went away. I knew that I
  could always release again in the future.
- Releasing this way forced me to center releases around visible
  changes (instead of toiling away/geeking out on the innerworkings
  of the engine).
- Getting good reviews (plus bad and hopeful ones) showed that people
  actually cared about what I was building.
- Multiple releases gave me more chances at being featured by
  Apple. With every non-trivial release, I got another opportunity to
  pitch to Apple.
- Different people would leave different reviews and provide
  feedback (always got a fresh pair of eyes). This was so much better than
  having internal beta testers. Just simply less to manage.
- New game mechanics ended up bubbling up that I probably would have
  never thought of if I did everything "behind closed doors".
- Interstitials within the game brought more people to A Dark Room and
  The Ensign.
- **It's better to have only 10 "day one" downloads of a game that you spent a
  month on, versus 10 "day one" downloads of a game that you spent a year on.**

## Revenue and Download Numbers Life Time ##

- May 2015: 4,748 DLs ($0)
- Jun 2015: 961 DLs ($397)
- July 2015: 2456 DLs ($951) ADR/TE got featured

- January 2016: 1128 DLs ($657)
- February 2016: 1665 DLs ($537) I got a huge number of downloads in
  China, to bad the Yuan and the pricing of Apps over there is utter
  trash. I made $89.00 USD after 849 downloads.
- March 2015: 24,372 DLs ($451) I made the game free for PI day (3/14/2016). Seemed
  only fitting. Dammit, I wish people would just fork over the dollar
  and buy my god damn games. Got some love on /r/AppHookup for doing
  the promotion.
- April 2016: 1102 DLs ($487) Still some residual downloads in China.
- May 2016: 13,624 DLs ($574) Made the app free for ANC's on year anniversary.
- June 2016: 961 DLs ($370) Still more residual downloads in
  China. Off of 396 downloads I made a whopping $41.52.
- July 2016: 25,000 DLs ($730.00) I made it free for a weekend and
  got some really good coverage from Slick deals and other
  syndications. I got a pretty decent feature from Apple under Best
  Game Updates, so I decided this would be a good time to bolster the
  5 star reviews I've been getting.
