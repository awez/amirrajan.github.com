## tl;dr; ##

Used Vim for many years. Changed to Emacs because its Vim bindings were spot on,
and the editor provides discoverability elements that make it easier to extend. If
your editor can do the key points in this blog entry, then there is no reason to
pick up Emacs.

# Vim Plugins #

My main motivation for moving away from Vim was Vimscript. I just didn't want
to invest in learning Vimscript, but felt that my lack of scripting knowledge was
limiting my ability to extend Vim even further than my plugin suite. Yes,
I'm aware of NeoVim, but there are other compelling reasons to move to Emacs (discussed
further down).

# Emacs Has Flawless Vim Bindings #

Vim bindings are incredible. I can't imagine editing code without them. It's the
main reason why I couldn't make the switch to editors such as Sublime, Atom, Eclipse, or
Xamarin Studio, XCode, AppCode, et al. These other editors have cursory Vim support,
but nuanced commands just aren't there (such as `[ESC]V5jA;[ESC]`).

Emacs on the other hand has pretty incredible Vim emulation through a plugin called `evil-mode`.
So to start using Emacs, I'd put the following lines into your `~/.emacs.d/init.el` and you'll
have a pretty comfortable environment to start working in. If anything ever fails to load,
just exit Emacs by continually hitting `Ctrl-x, Ctrl-c` and go back to Vim
to fix your `~/.emacs.d/init.el`. `Ctrl-g` is another shortcut key you should keep in mind (it's
synonymous to Vim's `[ESC]` used to exit whatever weird state you've found yourself in).

    (require 'package)

    ;;register package end points
    (push '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") package-archives)
    (push '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/") package-archives)

    ;;list of packages to install
    (setq package-list '(
        evil
        evil-leader))

    ;;use the package list to install
    ;;any packages
    (package-initialize)

    (unless package-archive-contents
        (package-refresh-contents))

    (dolist (package package-list)
        (unless (package-installed-p package)
            (package-install package)))

    ;;load evil and evil leader
    (require 'evil)
    (require 'evil-leader)

    ;;enable evil mode globally
    (evil-mode 1)

    ;;This is so I can spam the [ESC]
    ;;key and eventually exit whatever
    ;;state Emacs has put me in
    (define-key evil-normal-state-map [escape] 'keyboard-quit)
    (define-key evil-visual-state-map [escape] 'keyboard-quit)
    (define-key minibuffer-local-map [escape] 'minibuffer-keyboard-quit)
    (define-key minibuffer-local-ns-map [escape] 'minibuffer-keyboard-quit)

TODO:

- Find out what function is being executed by a key stroke.
- Find out what key stroke a function is bound to.
- Search for related functions.
- Execute editor functions by typing them in.
- Eval editor functions at a whim.
- Create small functions myself that use other functions.
- It has an easy way for me to bind a function to a leader key combonation (evil-leader).
- Easy to view source for a function I'm using.
- It isn't vim script, I'm off the Tim Pope bus, Mads Kritchesten bus.
