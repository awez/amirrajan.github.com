## tl;dr; ##

Used Visual Studio for many years. Used Vim for many years. Changed to
Emacs because its Vim bindings were spot on, and the editor provides
discoverability elements that make it easy to extend.

If your editor can do the key points under the "The List of Things You
Should Know How to Do With Your Editor", then there is no reason to
pick up Emacs. If your editor can't do the things in this list (or
it's very very hard and not fun to do), then you are not using an IDE,
you're using a ball and chain clasped firmly around your neck. You're
going to spend probably _two decades_ coding, why be hindered by your
IDE throughout this journey?

# History: Moving Away From Visual Studio to Vim #

I started to move away from Visual Studio back in 2010. I had to do
build automation using Rake, and Visual Studio's Ruby support was
nonexistant. That and I was doing more JavaScript, SCSS, and LESS. All
of which had subpar (nonexistant) support. I did all my C# development
in Visual Studio, but any other text editing that needed to be done,
was in Vim.

After a while, I got really good and using Vim bindings and felt
utterly broken in Visual Studio. Moving around using the mouse and
arrow keys added so much _cognative overhead_ when all I wanted to do
was get what I had in my head, through the keyboard, and on the screen
as fast as possible. The best way to explain Vim bindings is this:

>Imagine you're a samurai with a razor sharp sword, contemplating how
>to take down your opponent. You think. You visualize how you'll cut
>down your foe. Your blade remains sheathed, because you aren't ready
>to strike just yet.
>
>Clarity comes, and the path to victory can be seen in your mind's
>>eye. You unsheath your katana to attack. Within an instant, each
>intricate slash is executed, and your blade is placed back at your
>side. Your foe falls. A buttefly, caught fluttering in the fray of
>your blade, splits in half midflight... only after realizing it's
>been cut.

The unsheathing of the blade is synonymous to going into Vim's insert
mode. Using the mouse and arrow keys, is synonymous to a combination
padlock latched on to your sheath (which has to be unlocked every time
you want to use it).

With Vim bindings, the cognative overhead _between_ "thinking time"
and "writing time" _disappeared_.

What I also found was that my ability to edit code in _all_ languages
increased (albiet with a small productivity loss in editing C#). The
same key bindings and motions could be applied to refactor code, no
matter the language. I want to reiterate this, **Vim bindings makes you
efficient in editing and refactoring code in _all_ languages, at the
cost of extreme efficiency in one.**

That's what happened to me. **It became more important for me to be
proficient in editing the sum of JavaScript, Rake, CSS, SCSS, Html5,
Jade, and Markdown, over just being efficient in editing C#.**

I went so far as [creating a set of instructions for coding C# in Vim
on Windows back in 2012](https://github.com/amirrajan/katanspec/) when
it wasn't cool to use an editor other than Visual Studio to code C#.

# History: Moving Away From Vim #

My main motivation for moving away from Vim was VimScript and the [Tim
Pope Bus](http://www.vim.org/account/profile.php?user_id=9012) (if Tim
Pope die, I and many Vim users are screwed). I just didn't want to
invest in learning VimScript, but felt that my lack of scripting
knowledge was limiting my ability to extend Vim even further than my
plugin suite. Yes, I'm aware of NeoVim, and if you can do "the list of
things you should know how to do with your editor", in NeoVim, then
you're gold.

Aside: Emac's Vim bindings are incredible. As stated earlier, I can't
imagine editing code without them. **It's the main reason why I
couldn't make the switch to editors such as Sublime, Atom, Eclipse, or
Xamarin Studio, XCode, AppCode, et al. These other editors have
cursory Vim support, but nuanced commands just aren't there (such as
`[ESC]Ctrl+V 5j$A;[ESC]` which appends semicolons at the end of 5 lines).**

# The List of Things You Should Know How to Do With Your Editor #

## You Should Be Able to Write Simple Functions to Extend Your Editor ##

Extend your editor to do the following:

1. After highlighting a lines, I want to press Ctrl+!.
2. When pressing Ctrl+!, the highlighted line is sent to a shell and
   executed. For example you could highlight a line that says `echo
   hello world` and press Ctrl+!.
3. Upon executing the command a new vertical window is opened up pointing to a
   file called `./last_executed_command.txt` with the contents being
   the command you executed, followed by the output.

**If you can't extend your editor to do this (or it takes a large
amount of hoops to jump through), you have a problem.** It shouldn't
take you long at all to make a function like this.

Here is how you would do it in Emacs:

1. Create a file under `~/.emacs.d/` called `init.el`.
2. In that file, paste the following lines:

```

```

3. Open the editor, create a new file, and type `echo hello world`.
4. Highlight `echo hello world` and Press `Ctrl+!`.

TODO:

- Find out what function is being executed by a key stroke.
- Find out what key stroke a function is bound to.
- Search for related functions.
- Execute editor functions by typing them in.
- Eval editor functions at a whim.
- Create small functions myself that use other functions.
- It has an easy way for me to bind a function to a leader key combonation (evil-leader).
- Easy to view source for a function I'm using.
- It isn't vim script, I'm off the Tim Pope bus, Mads Kritchesten bus.
