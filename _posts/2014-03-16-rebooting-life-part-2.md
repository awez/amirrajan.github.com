##tl;dr;
_It's been 10 months since I went on a sabbatical. I'm still enjoying it (though I've had moments of weakness). I've also created some passive income, which will slow down my savings burn rate. I've accomplished a number of things, but not everything I wanted to do. So I'm extending it._

##Background

I'm assuming you've read [Rebooting Life (Part 1)](http://amirrajan.net/meta/2013/07/14/rebooting-life/). If you haven't, here were the goals I set out to accomplish during my sabbitical.

- Build iOS based applications (client/server).
- Build a freaking game.
- Present about software, contribute to open source.
- Build my development chops on stacks other than .Net.
- Have conversations with developers everywhere.
- Learn Haskell and get better with functional programming in general.
- Learn Lisp.
- Get into better shape.
- Read more books.
- Music, drawing and artsy stuff.
- Learn as much as I possibly can about software development (tools, frameworks, paradigms and the craft).

##Successes

I want to talk about my successes first. What in the world have I been doing for the past 10 months? Did I really accomplish anything of value? Or did I just waste my time?

##I built a freaking game

Michael Townsend created a minimalist web based idle game called A Dark Room. I "ported/built" it for iOS.

The word "built" is a loaded word. I didn't just port a game to iOS. I translated it to a mobile medium. I added my own artistic spin to the game. I wrote about it. I presented about it. I marketed it. I pushed it to a top spot in the App Store (at one point it was ranked #6 in the RPG Category... it's made it into the top 200 Games overall). And most importantly, I found that the saying "if you build it, they will come" is _completely, utterly false_. "Building" something takes an _immense_ amount of work.

[You can read about the entire journey so far right here. It's over 9000 words long. So just be aware it's long.](http://amirrajan.net/a-dark-room/#adarkroomstory)

##Present about software, contribute to open source

Check and check. I've given eight presenations in the last ten months. On topics that I cared about. I've created a number of [open source reference implementations for NodeJS](http://amirrajan.net/nodejs-by-example/). I've continued to help developers break down barriers and learn new things. I still want to make a contribution to a large open source project. That hasn't happened yet.

##Build my development chops on stacks other than .Net

My work in NodeJS and A Dark Room iOS kept me on OSX and the Linux stack (need a Mac to develop iOS apps, and NodeJS websockets on Windows is trash). For a good 5 months, I didn't boot into Windows for any long period of time. After a while, the Linux file hierarchies began to make sense. My skills with the terminal got better. I can commision an bare bones Linux virtual machine via ssh, and get a Node app up and running on nginx (that's a big deal for me). There is still so much I need to learn, but I feel that I've reached a good level of comfort now. Getting comfortable with the Linux ecosystem has allowed me to try new languages and platforms without much fuss.

##Music, Drawing, and Artsy Stuff

I've picked up drawing again (I drew quite a bit when I was younger, but didn't make time for it when I grew up). Thank you Eric Sowell for helping me get back into it. A picture is worth 1000 words. So here are a few of the pieces I've done.
