##tl;dr;
_Microsoft is trying to change the mainstream .Net culture. They are genuinely trying to promote open source software. Unfortunately, a culture has built up that (so far) doesn't look like it's changed. The general perception by .Net open source developers (not employed by Microsoft) is still: "if it isn't made or endorsed by Microsoft, the main stream .Net dev wont use it."_

##A timeline that shows how long mainstream .Net devs wait

I'm hoping the following timeline illustrates how long mainstream .Net devs wait to take advantage of a new framework. **It doesn't have to be this way**. We don't have to wait for Microsoft to endorse or build a clone of a popular framework. There are developers out there that have already done a lot of the heavy lifting. Support _them_. Give _them_ feedback, contribute to _their_ solutions, raise awareness. Don't just sit there and wait for Microsoft.
