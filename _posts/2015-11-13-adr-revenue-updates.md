It's been two years since A Dark Room iOS has been released. Michael and I
want to be as open as possible with our numbers so here they are [in raw
format](https://github.com/amirrajan/amirrajan.github.com/tree/master/adr-sales),
along with a summary (approximate). If you want to crunch these numbers and
possibly share any insight you find, that'd be wonderful.

##A Dark Room Year 1:

These numbers are from [last year's developer logs](http://amirrajan.net/a-dark-room/#oneyear):

A Dark Room went viral in UK and US. It was the #1 premium, "free to play app" in the
US for 18 days straight (with no feature/marketing from Apple).

##A Dark Room Year 2:

:-------------------------------------------------------- | ---------: |
Gross income (less Apple's share)                         |   144,270  |
My half of ADR (I happily give Michael his share)         |    72,135  |
33% income tax                                            |    23,804  |
12% self employment tax                                   |     8,656  |

I took up contract work becuase of the volatility of the App Store
(which is why my income tax is still at 33%).

Interestingly (and again for reasons unkown), A Dark Room went viral in
the UK Dec 2014. The experience and length of the viriality was
similar to [last time](http://amirrajan.net/a-dark-room/#minecraft),
but didn't have the long running side effect of going viral in the US.

Originally, I figured that ADR being #1 in the UK somehow triggered its
rise to the #1 spot in the US. Turns out that's not the case.

##The Ensign Year 1:

Around August of 2014, I released a prequel to A Dark Room called The Ensign.
I loved traversing the dusty path, and wanted an extremely difficult,
"Dark Souls like" experience. [Mission accomplished](http://killscreendaily.com/articles/ensign/),
here are the numbers:

[ Month ]    | [ Paid Downloads ] | [ Free Downloads ] | [ Apple Check ] |

Aug 2015     |  1,270 ($1.99)     |                    |         1,885   |
Sep 2015     |  2,340 ($0.99)     |  9,700             |         1,580   |

[ Month ]                                                 | [ Amount ] |
:-------------------------------------------------------- | ---------: |
Gross income (less Apple's share)                         |    54,115  |
33% income tax                                            |    17,857  |
12% self employment tax                                   |     6,493  |
Net                                                       |    29,765  |

The prequel is doing alright. It did extremely well the first month
(it was featured by Apple... unsolisited). I expect The Ensign sales to stay
at ~25% of A Dark Room sales.

A Noble Circle is a new game I'm working on. I took a different approach
with this game, being that I released a _barely_ playable version for free.
I wanted to get something out there, and show my next idea. It has been
received really well. After e months of free downloads, I made it a for
pay app, and am _still_ working on it. The reviews are still very supportive,
and are happy with the purchase (even though it's an unfinished product).

There was a significant spike in September because Apple featured me under
Best New Game Updates. It took a ton of work to build that releationship with
Apple (and get this feature). Of course, the number dropped right afterwards.

It remains to be seen if A Noble Circle will be as successfull as ADR or TE, but
I think it's too early to tell at this point (especially since I have many many
opportunities to get this app featured). With regards to getting assigned a direct
Apple contact, I'll be doing a detailed entry about what I went through
(and what I learned) soon.

[Here's a link to all my games](https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/amirali-rajan/id736683064), just in case you want to support me (or to say
thank you for this data).
